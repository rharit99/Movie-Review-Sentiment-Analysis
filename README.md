# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
This project utilizes SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest algorithms to analyze sentiments in movie reviews, applying Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and N-grams techniques for data preparation

### GitHub Repository Description for Sentiment Analysis Project üé¨

üîç **Project Overview:**  
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at performing sentiment analysis on long-form movie reviews. The project explores the effectiveness of various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest, on textual data processed using Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and N-grams techniques.

üõ† **Key Features:**
- **Text Preprocessing:** Utilizes advanced text cleaning techniques including stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Feature Extraction:** Implements Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and N-grams to transform text data into usable formats for machine learning models.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Compares performance across multiple algorithms with evaluations based on accuracy, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and more.

üìä **Tools & Technologies Used:**
- Python for all scripting and machine learning processes.
- Libraries such as NLTK for natural language processing, Pandas for data manipulation, and Scikit-learn for implementing and evaluating machine learning models.

üìà **Usage:**
- Instructions included for setting up the environment, processing the data, training the models, and evaluating the results.
- Users can clone the repository to run the notebooks, modify the code, or use the models with their own data.

ü§ù **Contribution:**
- Contributions are welcome! Whether it's improving the code, adding new models, or expanding the dataset, please refer to the contributing guidelines in the repository.

This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for anyone interested in applying machine learning to textual sentiment analysis, with a focus on robust preprocessing and diverse modeling strategies.
